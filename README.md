# why-i-started

My name is Adi.

I started this GitHub at a time when I was tired of waiting.
One year at home taught me that nothing changes unless I move first.

I don’t know exactly how far this journey will take me,
but I know why I began:

- I want financial freedom
- I want to build skills that matter
- I don’t want to depend on luck or consultants
- I want to look back one day and remember that this is where I chose action

If you’re reading this in the future:
You didn’t start because it was easy.
You started because you were done waiting.

Keep going.
