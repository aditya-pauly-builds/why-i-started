# why-i-started


My name is Aditya.

I created this GitHub repository at a point in my life where I was tired of waiting.
One year at home taught me that nothing changes unless I take action myself.

I don’t know exactly where this journey will lead,
but I know why I started:

- To build real technical skills
- To become financially independent
- To stop relying on luck or consultants
- To create opportunities instead of waiting for them

This repository exists as a reminder.
If I ever come back here in the future, I want to remember that this is where I chose discipline over comfort.

Started in 2026.
